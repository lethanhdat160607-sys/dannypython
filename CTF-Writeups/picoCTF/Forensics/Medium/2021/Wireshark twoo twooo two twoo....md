## 🔍 Challenge 


Can you find the flag?
shark2.pcapng

### 🧪 Logic Extraction:

I used the `wireshark` command to read the packets and I saw quite a lot of `HTTP` and web links, so I opened the HTTP object list and saw a flag file, but there were so many of them that I guessed it was just a dummy flag.

I use the `tshark` command to analyze network traffic. `-nr` reads the stored data file (`-r`) without reversing the domain name (`-n`) for faster reading speed, while `-Y 'dns'` applies a display filter, keeping only packets belonging to the DNS protocol.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools]
└─$ tshark -nr shark2.pcapng -Y 'dns'
```
Next, I used the command `grep -v '8.8.8.8'`, where `-v` removes the lines containing the string after the '8.8.8.8', and `8.8.8.8` removes packets related to Google's DNS (8.8.8.8) to reduce unnecessary data noise.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools]
└─$ tshark -nr shark2.pcapng -Y 'dns' | grep -v '8.8.8.8' 
```
Next, I use the `grep -v response` command in DNS to get the query and response packets. Here, we are only interested in what the client sends, so we remove the lines containing the word "response" to make the page the response data to the server.
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools]
└─$ tshark -nr shark2.pcapng -Y 'dns' | grep -v '8.8.8.8' | grep -v response
```
Next, use the `grep local` command to filter out lines containing the word "local". In this lab, the secret data is hidden in queries sent to domains ending in `.local`.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools]
└─$ tshark -nr shark2.pcapng -Y 'dns' | grep -v '8.8.8.8' | grep -v response | grep local
```
Next, use the `awk` command for extremely powerful text processing by column: `{print $12}` prints the content of column 12. They often hide flags in it.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools]
└─$ tshark -nr shark2.pcapng -Y 'dns' | grep -v '8.8.8.8' | grep -v response | grep local | awk '{print $12}'
```
Next, I use `sed 's/\..*//'` and `sed` uses the regular expression `s` to replace `\.`. I find the first dot, `.*` finds all the remaining characters after that dot, `//` replaces all of that with 'empty' (deletes it). This will cut off the last part of the domain name (`.reddshrimpandherring.com...`) and only keep the base64 string at the beginning.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools]
└─$ tshark -nr shark2.pcapng -Y 'dns' | grep -v '8.8.8.8' | grep -v response | grep local | awk  '{print $12}' | sed  's/\..*//' 
```
Next, I saw the `base64` code, but it turned out to be just a flag.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools]
└─$ tshark -nr shark2.pcapng -Y 'dns' | grep -v '8.8.8.8' | grep -v response | grep local | awk  '{print $12}' | sed  's/\..*//' | base64 -d
picoCTF{dns_3xf1l_ftw_deadbeef}}
```
## Run 
.flag picoCTF{dns_3xf1l_ftw_deadbeef}
